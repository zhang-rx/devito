A modulo-N Dimension (i.e., cycling over i, i+1, i+2, ..., i+N-1) that could
safely be turned into a modulo-K Dimension, with K < N. For example:

A Dimension whose upper limit may be rounded up to a multiple of the SIMD

"""
A Dimension used to index into tensor objects only through affine and regular
accesses functions. See :mod:`basic.py` for rigorous definitions of "affine"
